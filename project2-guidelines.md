# Project #2 - React Web Application

## The Goal 🎯

**This is your second project, where you can show off all you’ve learned this module!**

During this project, you will be developing a **Single Page Application (SPA)**, using **React**, consisting of **multiple views**.

**This project will be carried out individually**

## Important Dates 🗓️

### Pitch Presentation: June 4

Present at least 2 ideas to the LT in order to decide which project you'll develop.

### Project Start: June 6

We officially begin our project development!

**NOTE**: All labs and assessments need to be submitted by this date!

### MVP: June 25

You'll present your MVP - Minimum Viable Product - to the LT and TA. MVP means you should have a working project with your basic features working.

### Deploy: June 27

We'll deploy both frontend and backend together in order to have enough time to fix any problems that might appear after the deploy.

### Project Presentation: July 2

You'll present your projects for everyone! At the end the class will vote on the projects in 4 categories: **Most Aesthetically Pleasing, Most Challenging Coding Wise, Most Original Idea** and **Best Overall!** More info on the presentation below.

## Project Weeks Schedule 👩‍💻

### Standups

We gather in circle and everyone should answer the following questions:

1. What did I do last class (or the last time you worked on the project)
2. What will I do today
3. What are my blockers

### Project Development

We focus totally in developing the projects and the LT will be here to help you! To get help request it using the ticketing system on Slack!

## Project Requirements ✅

1. Create a **Single Page Application (SPA)**, using **React**, consisting of **multiple views**.
2. The **React application should be integrated** with a **mock backend** and an **external API** and should **perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**.
3. Your project should **be deployed online**, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
4. Have your \*\*project available on GitHub repositories: one for your front-end React application and the other for your back-end API.
5. Have at least **1 commits per day** on your project repository that you worked on.
6. Present a MVP - Minimum Viable Product.
7. Present your project to the class by the end of the module.

### Deliverables - by the end of module #2

1. A **working and deployed app** that **meets all technical requirements**, **built by you**.
2. The **URL** to the deployed **React app**.
3. The **two URLs** of your **GitHub repositories** (frontend and backend).
4. The URL of the **slides for your project presentation**.
5. Your **GitHub repos** must have a **README with the completed project documentation**.

### Presentation

1. Format: Talking with slides + project live demo
2. The demo must be made on the deployed site
3. Slides must be online (Canva, Google Slides, other of your choosing)
4. Presentation Structure:
   1. Title Slide - Project name and your name
   2. About Me: Present yourself
   3. Elevator Pitch: Present your project
   4. Technical Challenge: What was the hardest part and how did you overcome it
   5. Big Mistake: What was the biggest mistake and what did you learn
   6. Demo Link: You deployed version link should be on the final slide

### Tips:

1. Don't show your code, no one will read it
2. If something doesn't work, don't focus on in
3. Show your work and be proud of it
4. Practice your presentation
5. Have fun 🚀
